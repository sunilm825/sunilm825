Open your website to the world

Navigating the internet is a daily challenge for 20% of the world’s population. That’s the percentage of people with disabilities in the world today, and they’re unable to access your website. accessiBe's service coupled with our WordPress accessibility plugin enables a wide array of people with disabilities to use your website effectively, boosting your market reach.

To make websites accessible, accessiBe service utilizes two applications that run together. The AI-powered background process handles optimizations for the more complex requirements like screen-reader and keyboard navigation adjustments, while the accessibility interface handles UI and design-related adjustments.

How the AI-Powered process work:

Using contextual understanding and image recognition, accessiBe’s AI scans and analyzes websites to learn what elements and functionality they include, adjusting them to your users’ screen-readers. Automatic screen-reader adjustments include:
 - Alt Tags
 - State Controls
 - ARIA Attributes
 - Icons & Buttons
 - Roles & Landmarks
 - Forms & Validations

accessiBe’s AI learns and understands the structures and behaviors of your website’s elements on-the-fly, adding keyboard-only functionality to each of them. Automatic keyboard navigation adjustments include:
 - Dropdowns
 - Menus
 - Popups
 - Forms
 - Skip Links
 - Buttons

**An accessibility interface for customized accessibility**
accessiBe's interface provides an optimal online experience tailored to every user’s individual needs. There’s a range of seamless customization options that support multiple UI and design adjustments from content to display and more.

**How does accessiBe work? Automatically**

**Developed Side-By-Side with People with Disabilities**
